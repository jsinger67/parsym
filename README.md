# This is a work in progress

The idea is to have a graphical user interface to explore the symbols generated by `parol` during
the process of parser generation.

The tool should be helpful for developers of `parol`, especially me ðŸ˜‰.

Furthermore this project is my own investigation into technologies like using Rust in web
development and using tauri and React for user interfaces.
