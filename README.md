# Another symbol table browser for Parol

This project is a nearly complete rewrite of the already existing
[parol_symbols](https://github.com/jsinger67/parol_symbols).

The idea is to have a graphical user interface to explore the symbols generated by
[parol](https://github.com/jsinger67/parol) parser generator during the process of parser generation.

The tool should be helpful for developers of [parol](https://github.com/jsinger67/parol), especially
me ðŸ˜‰.

Furthermore this project is my own investigation into technologies like using Rust in web
development and using tauri and React for user interfaces.
